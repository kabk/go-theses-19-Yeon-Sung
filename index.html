                                  <p>Following Gilroy (1993)’s idea of sailing shipas “chronotope,”44 the VOC ship was not a marine vessel carrying just copper sticks or coins but conductors which interchanged knowledge, culture, politics, technology and ideologies such as Imperialism and Oriental- ism between two countries via this island.<br><br>A pictorial depiction of the party in the house of the Dutch chief of Dejima Island conceivably hypothesized the theory; not only the smelted copper but an “exotic oriental phantasma” of the Japanese female body in the oriental landscape was consumed as the commodity. (Figure 2.14) This finding, while preliminary, suggests that the proliferation of “Orientalism” was accelerated in Japan as Said (1978) later de ned Orientalism45 as a constructed misinterpretation of the Orient — the Asian continent, by the Occident —, the Europe- ans. More precisely speaking, “Japanese Orientalism” which developed into “Ja ponism”46 in European fantasy was later manifested in the island by Dutch white men.<br><br>The deception of an oriental body has been solidified more than three centuries, and it was firmly stereotyped under the European masculinity into the ideal Asian female protagonists who are obedient and beautiful as shown in the opera “Madama Butterfly.”: “her name was Chô-san, Miss Butterfly. She was so sweet and delicate [...] but the little girl-wife awaited that signal in vain. He never returned.”47<br><br>According to the “objectification theory,”48 the Asian female body was sexually objecti ed in a sociocultural context and treated as bodies that exist for the use and pleasure of men.49 The widespread portrayal of Asian women as a sexual object became the racial/cultural stereotype and stimulated the sexual exploitation at the present day.</p>

                                  On the year of 2016 in Hoorn, there was a magnificent local event celebrating the 400 years of the discovery of Cape Horn.70 The VOC ship “Halve Maen” was sailing through the artillery belched fire with a deafening roar, reminiscing past glories that was built upon hundreds of bodies who acted as slaves for the Dutch.

                                  Similar stance can be found in Japan. “The Japanese Society

                                  <p>This research attempts to inspect the colonial trajectory of copper to observe its both physical and spiritual transformation mainly in three countries: the Netherlands, Japan, and Korea. Through five steps of copper processes, along with the material and visual stud- ies in historiographic and theoretical perspectives, I also develop a contemporary argument of how copper acts as an agent creating the wounds in the modern era that inherits colonialism across time and territory.
                                  <br><br>Moreover, I, as a student, historian, graphic designer, a mem- ber of Korean artists in the Netherlands, take social responsibility by exploring possible artistic transfiguration for the future work based on the research I developed in this paper.
